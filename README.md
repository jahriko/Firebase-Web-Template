# Firebase Web Template

This template uses ReactJS. To get the basics of React, head over to https://beta.reactjs.org/learn

This template provides an already built in todo application. But we have removed parts of the code for you to fill them out, so you don't have to worry creating from scratch!

In ReactJS, components are created using functions or classes. Functions are often used to create simple components.

A function in React is just like a regular JavaScript function, but it returns JSX. JSX is a special syntax that allows you to write HTML-like code inside your JavaScript code.

Here's an example of a simple React component created using a function:

```js
function Greeting() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
